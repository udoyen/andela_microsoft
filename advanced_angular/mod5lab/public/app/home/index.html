<!-- Notice that we don't have a full HTML Document, 
and are going to display a message property on our 
vm object. You may also notice that there is 
no ng-controller in this HTML. This is being 
handled by the Route that we defined earlier, 
which binds the controller and sets 
the controllerAs to vm. -->
